## Express Server Application

## Project Overview

Welcome to my Node.js and Express server application! This project is designed to showcase core backend development techniques with a focus on building a RESTful API, leveraging custom middleware, rendering dynamic views, and enabling HTML form interactions.

## Key Features

- **Robust Server with Node.js & Express:**
  - A powerful server application built using Node.js and Express, handling HTTP requests and responses efficiently.

- **RESTful API Development:**
  - A fully functional RESTful API with endpoints supporting CRUD operations. This API serves as the backbone for client-server interactions.

- **Custom Middleware Magic:**
  - Custom Express middleware for enhanced functionality including request logging, error handling, and body parsing. This modular approach keeps the server organized and maintainable.

- **Dynamic View Rendering:**
  - Integration of a template engine (e.g., EJS or Pug) to render dynamic HTML views. This feature allows real-time content updates based on server data.

- **HTML Form Interactions:**
  - Interactive HTML forms to communicate directly with the API. Users can submit data, perform updates, and interact with the backend seamlessly.
