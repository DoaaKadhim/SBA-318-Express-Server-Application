# My Express Server Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive server application built using Node.js and the Express framework. It includes the development of a RESTful API, custom middleware, dynamic view rendering with a template engine, and interaction through HTML forms. This setup demonstrates essential backend development practices and web server management.

## Objectives

- **Node.js & Express:**
  - Develop a robust server application leveraging Node.js and Express. This server will efficiently handle HTTP requests, manage responses, and provide a foundation for building web applications.

- **RESTful API:**
  - Create a RESTful API using Express that supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API will serve as a bridge between the client-side application and the backend data or services.

- **Custom Middleware:**
  - Implement custom middleware functions in Express to enhance server functionality. Middleware will be used for logging, error handling, request body parsing, and other critical tasks that facilitate server operation and maintain code modularity.

- **Template Engine Integration:**
  - Integrate a template engine (e.g., EJS, Pug) to render dynamic HTML views. This feature allows for the generation of interactive and personalized web pages based on server-side data, enhancing the user experience.

- **HTML Form Interaction:**
  - Enable user interaction with the API through HTML forms. This functionality will allow users to submit data, perform actions, and interact with the server directly from the web interface.
